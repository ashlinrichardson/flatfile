# flatfile_tools
Scripts for wrangling arbitrarily large tables AKA "flat files"; python 2 and 3, C/C++ and R syntax are leveraged. Python3 now supported for building
* conversion from fixed-width format to csv
* parsing, slicing and some statistics manipulations included
    * column mode operations and summarization for discrete variables 
* robustness to extremely large file sizes (tested with csv files 100's of GB in size)

# requirements
Presently the scripts are tested for Cywin ("linux for Windows" platform) with gnu g++ and python 2 and 3 both installed, under a Windows 10 environment

# Instructions
Place a copy of the files in a folder named /bin in your private/home folder and click on bash.bat
